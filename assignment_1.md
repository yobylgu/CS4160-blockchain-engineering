# Lab 1: Proof of Work over IPv8

## Overview

In this assignment, you will build an IPv8 client **from scratch** that:

1. Connects to a running server via the IPv8 peer-to-peer network
2. Computes a Proof of Work (PoW) over your email **and** your GitHub repo URL
3. Submits the solution as an IPv8 message
4. Receives a response from the server (accepted or rejected)

Your public key is registered on the server upon success. **You are responsible for preserving your private key** (`.pem` file) — it is your identity for the rest of the course. If you do lose it before the deadline, the server allows re-registration with a fresh key against your existing email (see below), so you won't be locked out. Avoid this if you can. **After the deadline, the server is taken offline — no further submissions or re-registrations are possible.**

## Server Information

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Community ID | `2c1cc6e35ff484f99ebdfb6108477783c0102881` (20 bytes / 40 hex) |
| Server Public Key | `4c69624e61434c504b3a86b23934a28d669c390e2d1fc0b0870706c4591cc0cb178bc5a811da6d87d27ef319b2638ef60cc8d119724f4c53a1ebfad919c3ac4136c501ce5c09364e0ebb` (74 bytes / 148 hex) |
| Difficulty | 28 leading zero bits |
| Deadline | `2026-05-12T23:59:59 UTC` — after this time the server is shut down and no further submissions are possible |

You reach the server through IPv8's standard peer-discovery mechanism (see the [py-ipv8 documentation](https://py-ipv8.readthedocs.io/)). Join the community using the `community_id` above, and IPv8 will find peers in the community; your client then picks out the server from among them by matching the public key above.

**Verify the server before trusting responses.** Other peers in the community (e.g., your classmates' clients) will also be discoverable. Your client must filter peers by the server's public key; do not send your submission to, or accept responses from, peers whose public key doesn't match.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- py-ipv8 library: https://github.com/Tribler/py-ipv8
- Read the py-ipv8 documentation: https://py-ipv8.readthedocs.io/
- A **public GitHub repository** containing the source code of your client. The URL of this repo is part of your submission, and changing it later requires re-solving the PoW. Course staff may review this repository during grading; make sure it contains the full source of the client you used to submit.

## Proof of Work

### The Challenge

Find a nonce (non-negative integer) such that:

```
SHA256( email_utf8 || "\n" || github_url_utf8 || "\n" || nonce_as_8_byte_big_endian )
```

has at least **28 leading zero bits** (i.e., the first 3 bytes are all zeros *and* the next byte is < 16).

`||` means byte concatenation. `"\n"` is the single ASCII newline byte (`0x0A`) used as a field separator. Neither your email nor your URL may contain a newline.

### Hash Computation

The hash input is, in order:

1. Your official TU Delft student email address, encoded as UTF-8 bytes. Must end in `@tudelft.nl` or `@student.tudelft.nl` and be ≤ 254 bytes. The address is canonicalised for identity purposes (NFC, whitespace stripped, lowercased), but the PoW hash is verified against the exact bytes you submit — whatever you hash locally is what the server will hash.
2. A single `\n` byte.
3. The URL of your public GitHub repo for this lab, encoded as UTF-8 bytes. Must be non-empty, ≤ 512 bytes, and contain no whitespace or control characters. The server does **not** verify that the URL resolves or that the repository is reachable — that is your responsibility.
4. A single `\n` byte.
5. Your nonce, encoded as a **64-bit big-endian integer** (8 bytes). The wire format on the payload is a signed int64 (struct code `q`), but valid nonces are non-negative; i.e., `0 ≤ nonce ≤ 2^63 − 1`. Negative values will be rejected by the server.

With 28-bit difficulty, you should expect to try approximately 2^28 (~268 million) nonces before finding a valid one — typically 2–3 minutes on a laptop with an optimised loop, 5–8 minutes with a naive one. PoW search is a geometric process with high variance: on an unlucky run you may need 10–20 minutes even on fast hardware, so design your system to survive a long search (don't time out your own mining loop, persist progress if you can). **Any optimisations are very welcome.**

### Wire Protocol

Once you find a valid nonce, send it to the server as an IPv8 message.

#### Submission Message (message_id = 1)

| Field        | Logical Type | IPv8 Wire Format | Description |
|--------------|--------------|------------------|-------------|
| `email`      | UTF-8 string | `varlenHutf8`    | Your TU Delft email address |
| `github_url` | UTF-8 string | `varlenHutf8`    | URL of your public GitHub repo |
| `nonce`      | integer      | `q`              | The nonce that solves the PoW |

#### Server Response (message_id = 2)

| Field     | Logical Type | IPv8 Wire Format | Description |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|-------------|
| `success` | boolean      | `?`              | `True` if your submission is accepted |
| `message` | UTF-8 string | `varlenHutf8`    | Human-readable result |

Both messages are authenticated using IPv8's `BinMemberAuthenticationPayload`. Your public key is automatically included and verified by IPv8 authentication; it is not part of the message payload.

#### Server Responses

| Response | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `success=True, message="Accepted"` | Your PoW is valid, you are registered |
| `success=True, message="Accepted (already registered)"` | Same (email, key, URL) resubmission — you already passed |
| `success=True, message="Accepted (github URL updated)"` | Same key and email, new URL with a fresh valid PoW |
| `success=True, message="Accepted (re-registered with new key)"` | Same email, new key — e.g., a lost-key recovery |
| `success=False, message="Rejected: invalid hash — need 28 leading zero bits, got N"` | Your hash doesn't meet the difficulty |
| `success=False, message="Rejected: this public key is already registered with a different email"` | You can only use one email per key |
| `success=False, message="Rejected: email must be a well-formed TU Delft address ..."` | Email is empty, malformed, or the domain is not `tudelft.nl` / `student.tudelft.nl` |
| `success=False, message="Rejected: github_url must be non-empty, ≤ 512 chars, and contain no whitespace/control chars"` | GitHub URL field failed validation |
| `success=False, message="Rejected: nonce must be a non-negative integer that fits in 63 bits"` | Nonce is negative or ≥ 2^63 |
| `success=False, message="Rejected: malformed submission payload ..."` | Packet reached the server but fields couldn't be decoded as `(email: string, github_url: string, nonce: int64)` |

### Policy on Identity Changes

- **One email per public key.** Once you register with an email, that email is permanently bound to your key. Submitting the same key with a different email is rejected.
- **Changing the GitHub URL (before the deadline).** Submit the same (email, key) with the new URL and a fresh valid PoW over that URL; the server will reply `Accepted (github URL updated)`.
- **Lost-key re-registration (before the deadline).** If you lose your `.pem`, you may submit a fresh key with the same email and a valid PoW; the server will reply `Accepted (re-registered with new key)`.
- **After the deadline.** The server is stopped at `2026-05-12T23:59:59 UTC`. Submissions, URL edits, and re-registrations are all impossible once that happens.

## Grading

- **Pass/fail.** The server either has your public key registered as passed by the deadline, or it doesn't.
- **Deadline: `2026-05-12T23:59:59 UTC`.** After this time the server is stopped; no further submissions are possible.

## Tips

- Start by reading the py-ipv8 overlay tutorials. Understand how communities, messages, and peer discovery work before writing code.
- Test your PoW computation locally before trying to send anything over the network.
- Decide your GitHub URL **before** mining. Mining a nonce binds you to that specific URL string; changing even a trailing `/` will invalidate the hash and require mining again.
- Use `curve25519` as your key generation type (IPv8 default).
- Your client must register a handler for the response message (`message_id = 2`) so it can receive the server's reply.
- The server verifies the sender's identity via IPv8's built-in message authentication. You do not need to include your public key in the message payload.
- If you get "invalid hash" responses, double-check your hash construction matches the spec exactly: UTF-8 encoding for both strings, `\n` separators, 8-byte big-endian nonce, SHA-256.
- If you get no response at all (timeout), the most likely cause is that your packet isn't being properly signed by IPv8 — unsigned or wrongly-signed packets are dropped without a reply. Make sure your client uses IPv8's standard authenticated send (e.g. `ez_send`) so the submission carries a valid signature for your key.

### Minimum Client Checklist

Your client must be able to:

1. Load or generate an IPv8 key pair
2. Join the Lab 1 community using the community ID above
3. Discover the server peer through IPv8 peer discovery
4. Compute a valid PoW over `(email, github_url, nonce)`
5. Send the submission message with your email, github URL, and nonce
6. Receive and display the server response

### Common Failure Cases

- Encoding the nonce in the wrong byte order
- Hashing the text form of the nonce instead of its 8-byte binary form
- Forgetting the `\n` separators in the hash input
- Accidentally including a trailing newline or whitespace in your URL string
- Using a non-TU-Delft email domain
- Changing your URL without re-mining a nonce for the new URL
- Forgetting to register a handler for the response message
- Accepting any peer in the community as the server instead of filtering by the server's public key
- Accidentally using a different private key than the one you intend to keep for later labs

## Deliverable

A working IPv8 client that:

1. Connects to the server's community
2. Computes and submits a valid PoW with your email and github URL
3. Receives and displays the server's response

You are done when you receive `Accepted`, `Accepted (already registered)`, `Accepted (github URL updated)`, or `Accepted (re-registered with new key)`.

There is nothing to submit manually. The repository URL you submitted is the canonical location of your client code; your public key is your proof of completion.


# Anouncement 1 
Hi All, we had a bug inside our lab assignment server. Our IPv8 overlay was not as robust as should be. Apologises for the people who encountered this bug and lost time because of this. Please re-try your code now.

Then about connecting to the IPv8 server... Overlay networks are not real-time. Please read IPv8 docs. The IPv8 community ID is given in the assignment. Also IPv8 public key of server is provided. Please be aware of the general properties of overlay networks, they are not instant. It builds upon slow peer discovery, public key discovery, and NAT puncturing processes.

The assignment text hopefully clarifies fully what is required, use 3 personal accounts for lab 1; work together in lab 2:
## Prerequisites and deliverable

Use the **same Ed25519 key pair** each member used in Lab 1. The server checks every member's key against Lab 1's records and rejects any key not found there.
Add your Lab 2 client code to the **same personal GitHub repository** each member registered in Lab 1. Each member commits to their own repo.
If a teammate lost their Lab 1 key, they recover it in Lab 1 first (`email + new key`), then your trio registers a fresh Lab 2 group with the new key. Old groups stay on the records and are harmless.

Hope this helps, johan.
